      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project involved designing, simulating, and fabricating a custom RF
        stripline circuit using a Chebyshev bandpass filter topology. The
        primary objective was to achieve a center frequency of 1.89 GHz and a
        bandwidth of 600 MHz. The work was carried out as part of a university
        lab focused on exploring the fundamentals of high-frequency circuit
        design and measurement techniques.
      </p>

      <p>The development process included several key steps:</p>
      <p>
        Design Phase: Theoretical calculations to determine impedance and
        admittance parameters for a 5th-order Chebyshev filter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simulation and Validation: Using AWR software to simulate the design
        with discrete components and microstrip technology, focusing on
        S-parameter analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fabrication and Measurement: PCB fabrication using Isola 680 material,
        followed by post-fabrication testing to evaluate real-world performance
        against simulations.

      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        While simulations provided an idealized understanding of circuit
        behavior, the transition to physical implementation presented
        challenges. Key takeaways included:
      </p>
      <p>
        Handling fabrication tolerances and impedance mismatches that affected
        bandwidth and reflection characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Observing a 300 MHz shift in the filter bandwidth, likely due to
        soldering and manufacturing imperfections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifying harmonic behavior and unexpected damping effects in
        transmission plots.
